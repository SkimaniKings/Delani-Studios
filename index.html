        <p class="about">
            When you work with us, you are part of a team of committed
            collaborators. All aspects of our software development process are
            integrated, interactive and agile. <br />
            Our approach unifies design, development and product management to
            create exceptional products. <br />
            We start each project by understanding your business goals, the userâ€™s
            needs and the product requirements.
            <br />
            Then we help translate them into effective and elegant solutions.
