        <p class="about">
            When you work with us, you are part of a team of committed
            collaborators. All aspects of our software development process are
            integrated, interactive and agile. <br />
            Our approach unifies design, development and product management to
            create exceptional products. <br />
            We start each project by understanding your business goals, the userâ€™s
            needs and the product requirements.
            <br />
            Then we help translate them into effective and elegant solutions.

            Before we sign a contract or write a line of code or team will spend the
            necessary time needed to understand your product vision. <br />
            The outcome of this scoping session is proposal or high-level statement
            of work. <br />
            Based on your requirements, we can provide a complete offering or just
            the pieces you need.

                        design and workflows, solicit user feedback and work with you to
                        make sure what gets built is what is needed.

                    <p id="design3">
                        Planning and development is iterative. Because we are constantly
                        coding and testing, the products we build are always ready to go
                        live. <br> This iterative process allows for changes as business
                        requirements involve.
